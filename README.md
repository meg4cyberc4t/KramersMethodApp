# KramersMethodApp
 A lightweight application on Flutter for calculating the matrix by the Kramer method


P.s. This application is made in a hurry for an artifact in higher mathematics. Yes, I'm writing everything here in one file. Yes, it is better not to do calculations in initState. This is not an example of a proper application, but just open source code for others.
